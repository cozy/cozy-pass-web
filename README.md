Hack
------------------

### Install and run in dev mode

Hacking the Cozy Pass app requires you to [setup a dev environment][setup].

You can then clone the app repository and install dependencies:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cozy/cozy-pass-web.git
$ cd cozy-pass-web
$ npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

:pushpin: If you use a node environment wrapper like [nvm] or [ndenv], don't forget to set your local node version `14` before doing a `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`.

:warning: _cozy-pass-web uses [cozy-ui] and [cozy-client], take a look at the ["living on the edge" note](#living-on-the-edge) below to know hot to install and configure the latest available versions.


### Build the web-app

```bash
npm run build:browser:prod   # to build into `build-browser` for production
npm run build:browser:watch  # to build into `build-browser` and watch changes
```

### Living on the edge

[Cozy-ui] is our frontend stack library that provides common styles and components accross the whole Cozy's apps. You can use it for you own application to follow the official Cozy's guidelines and styles. If you need to develop / hack cozy-ui, it's sometimes more useful to develop on it through another app. You can do it by cloning cozy-ui locally and link it to yarn local index:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cozy/cozy-ui.git
cd cozy-ui
yarn install
yarn link
```

then go back to your app project and replace the distributed cozy-ui module with the linked one:

```sh
cd cozy-pass-web
yarn link cozy-ui
```

You can now run the watch task and your project will hot-reload each times a cozy-ui source file is touched.

[Cozy-client] is our API library that provides an unified API on top of the cozy-stack. If you need to develop / hack cozy-client in parallel of your application, you can use the same trick that we used with [cozy-ui]: yarn linking.
